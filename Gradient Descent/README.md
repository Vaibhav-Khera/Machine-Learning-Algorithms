# What is Gradient Descent?
> Optimization is a big part of machine learning. Almost every machine learning algorithm has an optimization algorithm at its core.

> Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function (cost).\
Gradient descent is best used when the parameters cannot be calculated analytically or when you need an optimized way to calculate those parameters.

# Intuition for Gradient Descent
> Suppose you are at the top of a mountain, and your goal is to reach a lake which is at the lowest point of the mountain. A twist is that you are blindfolded, and you
have zero visibility to see where you are headed.

> - The best way is to check the ground near you and observe where the land tends to descend. This will give an idea in what direction you should take your first step.

> - If you follow the descending path, it is very likely you would reach the lake. Any position on the mountain is the cost value evaluated by the current values of
the coefficients (values of coefficients corresponding given by that point on bowl).
The lake is the point where the cost will be minimum. The goal is to find this
point.
