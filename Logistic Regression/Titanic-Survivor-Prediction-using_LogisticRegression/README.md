# Logistic Regression on Titanic Dataset

> **In this project I'm attempting to do data analysis on the Titanic Dataset.**
> **In the first step I'm doing a very quick data exploration and preprocessing on a visual level, Then I've done some data cleaning and built a Classifier that can predict whether a passenger survived or not.**

### Dataset Description:
- Survived: Survived (1) or died (0)
- Pclass: Passenger’s class
- Name: Passenger’s name
- Sex: Passenger’s sex
- Age: Passenger’s age
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Fare
- Cabin: Cabin
- Embarked: Port of embarkation. C- Cherbourg, S – Southampton, Q - Queenstown

### Results
> **The classifier built here has a prediction score of 0.81, i.e., we get an average accuracy of 80+%. This is a pretty good accuracy for starters and could be improved upon by coming up with newer, better features by using some feature engineering. This is something I could work on in the future.**
